|---|---|---|
| primeFactors.cpp | N/A | Calculates the prime factors of a given number. Currently defunct. |
| 3perfectNums.cpp | 3 | Brute forces the first 3 perfect numbers. Can possibly go higher with enough time. |
| 8perfectNums.cpp | 8 | Uses Mersenne Primes to calculate the first 8 perfect numbers. Integer overflows prevent going higher. |
| Makefile | N/A | Can be run by itself to make all (completed) files in this directory. |
| dev.cpp | ? | Developmental version aiming to surpass completed files. |
| MakefileDev | N/A | Can be run to make dev.cpp |
