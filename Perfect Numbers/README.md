# Perfect Numbers Calculator
This project is designed to calculate the highest number of perfect numbers. Each code file is an iteration on the project.

| File | Desc. |
|---|---|
| primeFactors.cpp | Calculates the prime factors of a given number. Currently defunct. |
| 3perfectNums.cpp | Brute forces the first 3 perfect numbers. Can possibly go higher with enough time. |
| 8perfectNums.cpp | Uses Mersenne Primes to calculate the first 8 perfect numbers. Integer overflows prevent going higher. |
| Makefile | Can be run by itself to make all (completed) files in this directory. |
| dev.cpp | Developmental version aiming to pass completed files. |
| MakefileDev | Can be run to make dev.cpp |
